Kaiki AKA Wizzo, for all of the database of RBY, he spent alot of time and effort making sure all of those mons, were perfect.
Roc's PC, for making an incredible Event Database of all of the Pokemon through the ages, and while this is a database specifically designed with the competitive SM metagame of various tiers in mind, I highly recommend checking out his database and collection.
