Introduction
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Hello there were always kicking it Retro and I am Retrosol.  I do Past Generations Pokemon Content, and Various 8 Bit/ 16 Bit
Video game content.  I also do some Rom Hacks, sometimes, mostly spin offs, and 8/16 bit games
Here is my Channel
https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCTqgtt8G0_IERZdk7D1sNAA


The entire point and birth of this Github is to have a nice clean organized place to upkeep the files
of the Competitive Pokemon Sun and Moon Database PK7/EKX Database
This is the beginning video
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWt1mh8k3zg&t=177s

For this video I poorly put this all together as a PK7 Database, now to 
the point of this github if create a manageable database for Battle Ready Competitive Sun and Moon Pokemon
This will continue to update and change as new mons/sets are added.


TO BE CLEAR THIS IS A SMOGON COMPETITIVE Ultra Sun and Ultra Moon DATABASE
**THIS** means you will not find **NON-COMPETITIVE** Event Pokemon here.  You may Find **Competitive** *EVENT POKEMON*
WITH COMPETITIVE MOVESETS. 

You need **Homebrew Launcher** to take complete advantage of the Database.
As Homebrew Launcher allows you to use at least **PKSM**, and **Checkpoint** to be able to inject Pokemon, 
or Simply Entire Save Files. As some Pokemon in the Database are Createable, and Injectable but **NOT TRADEABLE**
http://smealum.github.io/3ds/ - **Link for Possible Homebrew Launcher Exploits**
**IF YOU ARE ON 11.6 BUT HAVE SPECIFIC GAMES/ CORRECT FLASHKART / OR A PREVIOUSLY HACKED CONSOLE THIS IS STILL POSSIBLE.**


**PRIMARY** Means accessing Homebrew for the **first** TIME.
**SOUNDHAX** Was primary, as was **RPGPWN**
**1A** :Games you **NEED** for **PRIMARY** access are as follows.

`FreakyForms Deluxe,
Legend of Zelda Ocarina of Time/ **REQUIRES 3DS POWERSAVES TO BE PRIMARY**,
Cubic Ninja,
Super Smash Bros 3ds - N3DS **ONLY**  *THIS IS MOST COMPLICATED METHOD AND **REQUIRES** LINUX!**`

If Using Please immediately install **SECONDARY HAX**, which **REQUIRES PRIMARY HAX**, section **1A** covers this.



**2A** : Games/Software you need for **SECONDARY HAX**, which **REQUIRES PRIMARY HAX** are the following

`Steel Diver: Sub Wars, 
Pokémon Super Mystery Dungeon,
Citizens of Earth (either v1 or v2),
Paper Mario: Sticker Star,
Monster Hunter Generations or Monster Hunter X (without the game updates installed), and an internet connection during installation,
Pixel Paint`



I realize it's been 12.5 months and its Not Completed, so heere is why

^ This Program is what I have been using to create my Database.  
However this program is INCREDIBLY finnicky when it comes to the formatting.
Sometimes Pokemon Showdown, and Pokepaste Modify slight variations of the formatting, that ImportableConverterUSUM will accept.


so now using **KEYSAVE**, I am now able to customize the formatting of my live read Nintendo 3ds Files, into a File Type My Database Uses.
This is also so that is useable, **regardless of which PKHEX you are using, the Regular, or Architdates Auto-Legality Mod**

```{{speciesName}}_{{itemName heldItem}}_{{natureName}}_{{abilityName}}_{{ballName}}_{{moveName move1}}_{{moveName move2}}_{{moveName move3}}_{{moveName move4}}_{{typeName hpType}}_.ekx```

**Furthermore**, ImportablePKHex does **NOT** Handle Valid **PID** *Encryption*
This is via **ENCOUNTER TYPE, INVALID PID FOR PREVIOUS GENERATIONS, OR SHINY ENCOUNTER MISMATCHES THAT ARE SHINY LEGALLY, AND LEGITIMATE**
While PID Encryption errors are very easy to ignore, They make where the Pokemon Have the Invalid Flag Regardless of what is done.


    **IF YOU ARE HAVING TROUBLE, ALL YOU NEED TO DO IS SEND ME A REQUEST ON DISCORD
    Retrosol#3697, and tell me which pokemon in database you would like, me to trade to you.**

Installing
------------------------------------------------------------------------



Use any unzipping program. (Winrar recommended)
You will get a folder, with a bunch of folders inside, telling you what Tiers Pokemon are in
There are folders for each tierset of Pokemon.

You need to download PKHex, and drag my files into your save file from your Pokemon Ultra Sun and Pokemon Ultra Moon.
